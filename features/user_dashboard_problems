Feature: User should be able to interact with his problems
  As a User,
  So that I can keep track of my problems,
  I want to be able to see my submitted and accepted problems.

Background:
  Given the site is set up
  And I add the "water" skill to the database
  Given I am on the problem submission page
  And I select "water" from "skills"
  And I fill in "Problem Summary" with "Broken Pipe"
  And I press "Submit Problem"
  And I log out
  
  Given I add the "water" skill to the database
	Given I add the "electronics" skill to the database
  And I am on the create account page
  And I fill in the following fields:
      |Email          | Account Name | Password | Name | Phone Number | Location |
      | test@test.com | Tester       | Password | Test | 1234567890   | Panama   |
  And I press "Create Account"
